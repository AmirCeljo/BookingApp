This was a assignment project on ITAcademy that I had to present to the commision for my final grade to obtain a certification. 

Technology stack include React, Node.js and MySQL. 

Since I use Netifly to have this application up and running I had to upload only the frontend of an application and you can check out the backend code in my repository by the name BookingApp-backend.

Currently my backend is up and running on Heroku which I connected with Heroku CLI and I use Heroku Github to deploy it but anyways, i shared my code here on Github as well.
