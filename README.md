This was a assignment project on ITAcademy that I had to present to the commision for my final grade to obtain a certification. 

Technology stack include React, Node.js and MySQL. 

Since I use Netifly to have this application up and running I had to upload only the frontend of an application and you can check out the backend code in my repository by the name BookingApp-backend.

Currently my backend is up and running on Heroku which I connected with Heroku CLI and I use Heroku Github to deploy it but anyways, i shared my code here on Github as well. 

Please note that this is a project that I have bulit when I was starting to learn and I am updating it constantly. Currently Im working on optimization of the code and well structuring it and consider that this project is still in development even tho is accesible and open.

Currently I have updated the UI and Im currently working on optimizing backend. But still if you want to check out how it works , you can register and login.

If you want to log in as admin so you can see admin dashboard and all cool functionalities , go ahead and use: 

username = admin
password = 123456

Have a great day !
